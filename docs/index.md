The Teaching and Learning Unit (TLU) has a collection of modern, highly-available systems that provide the capability to deliver agile software solutions to the BCIT community.

We:

- deploy containerized workloads to Kubernetes
- use CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments
- write infrastructure as code (IaC) to store and track configuration
- monitor and log workloads to minimize service interruptions and effectively respond to incidents
